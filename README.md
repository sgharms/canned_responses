This repository is an example tutorial repository for building an Event Page
for Google Chrome extensions. It's used to inject boilerplate content into
LinkedIn messaging text fields.

Please bear in mind this was written in 2019 and the Chrome API has certainly
moved on since then. Additionally, as developers I feel we need to take 
a moment and realize that the Chrome browser is a tool for more intimate
tracking of individuals. As of the present, I'm pulling back from all
Google product use.
